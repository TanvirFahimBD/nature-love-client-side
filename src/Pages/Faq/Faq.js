The best time to prune a tree depends on the type of tree. Typically, we recommend pruning while the tree is in its dormant state, meaning they aren’t in a season of growth. This commonly occurs during the changing of the seasons. The best way to know when to prune, however, is to research the type of tree, or to give your arborist a call!.</p>

                                                                                                                                       Medium light plants should stay out of the direct sunlight. They should be placed in a bright room and will enjoy partial or filtered sunlight.

                                                                                                                                       Low light plants prefer to stay in the shade or to be displayed under fluorescent light.

                                                                                                                                       Heat dries out the air the most, and misting pants that love humidity daily during the cold season is essential.

                                                                                                                                       AC will remove moisture from the air as well but not as much. Mist your humidity loving plants at least few times a week during the warm season.

                                                                                                                                       A humidifier is also a good option. Your skin and your plants will benefit from it equally :)</p>

If you do not see the roots poking out of drainage holes, you can wait for a few months and take your time to find a perfect pot for your green baby. Otherwise, repot it rather sooner than later.

                                                                                                                                       Choose a pot 1-3 inches larger than the original container. Pots with drainage are always the best choice but if you found an awesome cache pot that you must have, make sure to add a good layer of rocks at the bottom of a pot to provide a drainage for your plant. </p>

If you have not watered your plant for a while and soil feels too dry, give your plant a good drink and make sure to test the soil at least once every 2 weeks.

Lower watering frequency for the future or/and use less amount of water for each watering. Always check soil before watering plants.</p>

                                                                                                                        <h5 className="font-weight fs-5" >WHERE THOSE BUGS COME FROM?</h5>
                                                                                                                        <p  > Cut Flowers: Cut flowers, whether from the store or the garden, are another possible carrier of houseplant bugs like aphids, spider mites, and mealybugs.

                                                                                                                                       Fruits and Vegetables: Whether from the grocery store or the backyard garden, fresh produce can carry all types of houseplant bugs.

                                                                                                                                       Other Bugs: It sounds crazy, but bugs like ants are known to bring sap-sucking pests like aphids, scale, and mealybugs to a houseplant.

                                                                                                                                       Other Plants: Mealybugs can come from any other plants that are nearby or plants that are anywhere in a building as they are can get around via air vents.

                                                                                                                                       Doors, Air vents, and Windows: Houseplant insect pests, like soil gnats and spider mites, can easily come even through the screens of open windows/doors (especially during warm seasons) or from anywhere in the building through an air vent.

                                                                                                                                       Soil: If a plant had gnat's eggs in the soil (which are invisible to the human eye) you will notice an issue very early, within first few days, as these guys spread super fast.  </p>

                                                                                                                        <h5 className="font-weight fs-5" >WHAT ARE THE LITTLE DARK FLIES SWARMING OVER THE POTS OF MY PLANTS?</h5>
                                                                                                                        <p>  They are probably fungus gnats. They are not very harmful to plants but very annoying to us:)

                                                                                                                                       These guys can come from anywhere - air vents, drain pipes, etc. They find nice warm and moist environment to lay their eggs in. Frequent or excessive watering encourages their development. You can usually get rid of them by reducing the frequency of watering and allowing the soil to dry more between watering.

                                                                                                                                       Read our post about How to Get Rid Of Gnats. </p>
