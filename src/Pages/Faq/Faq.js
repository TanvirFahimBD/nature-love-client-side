The best time to prune a tree depends on the type of tree. Typically, we recommend pruning while the tree is in its dormant state, meaning they aren’t in a season of growth. This commonly occurs during the changing of the seasons. The best way to know when to prune, however, is to research the type of tree, or to give your arborist a call!.</p>
