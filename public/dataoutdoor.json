                     "about": "Citrus of all kinds — most commonly lemons, limes, kumquats, oranges and tangerines — can be grown in large containers and make pretty accents on patios, in herb gardens or tucked into a garden bed. All citrus plants are frost-tender; in cold climates, plan on bringing the trees inside to a sunny window or greenhouse.If citrus leaves begin to yellow or drop, it’s most likely a sign of nitrogen deficiency. Supplement watering with a weekly or bimonthly feeding of diluted organic fertilizer during the growing period to set up container-grown citrus for success.",
